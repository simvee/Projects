# Projects
What I worked on to understand the data science and statistics better. 

Following are short descriptions of projects that I worked, why I chose to do them and what I wanted to explore through them. 

## Boston Advanced Housing Regression
An extended version of the traditional housing prices dataset. This dataset contained about 80 variables in all - including 18 numerical categories, multiple ordinal categories (quality ratings) and a few nominal categories. 

Areas of enquiry
1. How does the presence of outliers affect the test rmse?
2. Does PCA and removal of multicollinearity improve the test rmse?
3. How should we handle “outliers” in ordinal categories?
4. How should we handle outliers in continuous variables where most values are the same, except a few?
